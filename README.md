### How to Contribute

The goal is to create a reading list of important articles for any developer. This is NOT a "pool of interesting articles"
(otherwise, it'd grow endlessly). We can think in it more like a _must read_ list. To stick with this principle, we might
limit the number of articles in the near future.

Some criteria we used to create the list:

1. The article/talk is a well done summary of one or more good programming practices (e.g., [Steps to better code](https://medium.com/@isaaclyman/steps-to-better-code-e6c3cce0c7f9))
2. The article/talk presents a very clever solution for some problem (e.g., [Move Fast and Fix Things](https://githubengineering.com/move-fast/))

To contribute, if you are outside ESSS Org, edit this file (you can do this through the GitHub UI), add the
title/link/author in the correct position to keep the list sorted and submit the change as a PR.

If you are inside ESSS Org, first share the article/talk via Chat or on Dev mailing list. If you get some thumbs up, submit the PR as explained above.
